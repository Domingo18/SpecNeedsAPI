Special education is a somewhat neglected field and with this API I intend to retrieve as much data I can from public APIs.
Then rearrange it and output data that isolates key data points for any logistical question pertaining to Special Education.
As of 2024 this will mainly be using data from NYC Open Data so the scope will be for D75 public schools.
